# [Project 1: Environmental, Social and Governmental](https://github.com/Karene123/ESG-Project)

I collaborated with classmates and we conducted a simple and multiple linear regression analysis to examine the relation between a population lifespan and 20 response variables such as C02 emissions or political stability. This dataset was published by the WORLD BANK. At the end of our research we were able to come up with a regression model to address our research question.  

Those are some of the graphs we created:

### Use GGPAIRS to evaluate the correlations between variables

### Conduct a simple linear regression (Political Stability)

### Examine Multicollinearity

# [Project 2: Media News](https://github.com/Karene123/Media-New-Project)

We collected a dataset published by the Pew Research Center. We then came up with three potential hypotheses on the dataset. Following those steps we had to clean, organize and explore the dataset through visuals. After exploring we were able to draw a conclusion and write a discussion based on the litterature review we did. 

Those are some of the graphs we created:

### Explore the relationship between Method of News Intake and the Amount of Trust In Others

### Explore the relationship between

### Check if the numbers are accurate

# Project 3: Sgroup Package
I collaborated with some classmates to build this R-package.
This R-package contains 20 of the small finite groups. Each users is able to test, check and produce the desired outcome.

This is some parts of the vignette we created to explain how to use this package:
Cyclic 8 is one of the groups we decided to work on. This group will be used as an example to demonstrate our work.

### If the user desires to create a Cyclic_8 group.

### If the user desires to check whether the object belongs to the Cyclic_8 group.

### If the user desires to check the group name

### If the user desires to verify if a specific group is inside the sgroupr package

# Project 4: Web Scraping 
I collaborate with a classmate to work on this project.
We were interested in exploring the trends in the youth population across the United States. To do so, we visited the US Census Bureau website that contains many data sets about population that we can take advantage of through webscrapping with API techniques.

Those are some of the graphs we created:

### Create a graph to determine the amount of Black individuals under 18 by state in 2010

### Create a graph to determine the amount of White individuals under 18 by state in 2010
